                    <p>TradeEasy – A Zerodha-Inspired Full-Stack Trading Platform (Built Solo Using MERN)

TradeEasy is a modern, high-performance stock trading platform inspired by Zerodha, designed and developed entirely by me, Yash Chandel. The platform reimagines the trading experience by combining clean UI, secure backend engineering, and powerful utility tools tailored for both new traders and experienced investors.

Built using the MERN stack, TradeEasy is not just a feature clone — it’s an upgraded, developer-driven interpretation of a trading ecosystem. I engineered every layer of the application, from scalable APIs and authentication workflows to real-time market interactions and intuitive dashboards.

With a strong focus on performance, security, and usability, TradeEasy introduces additional productivity tools that make trading simpler, more informative, and more accessible. From data-driven insights to streamlined order execution, every component is crafted to deliver a smooth, reliable, and user-centric experience.

This project reflects my full-stack capabilities, problem-solving approach, and ability to independently architect and execute complex, production-grade applications.</p>
